# crudapp
This is a simple project that i did in less than a day to refresh myself about django. 
You can signup and create a create your profile and then add or delete new todo tasks to your profile. 
I used Bulma in this project because i wanted to tryout new css framework. I found BUlma to be more easier to learn and beautiful than Bootstrap. 
I plan to integrate vuejs in this project just for learning purpose. I wanted to see how much better can i do with vue and django.
